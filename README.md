# LR-IPM
A cost estimation application designed for Manitoba Hydro's LR/IPM jobs. The goal is to use the excel tables created by the distribution design engineers, have them specify which column contains which information, then scan a database (currently an excel file for testing purposes) for the required parts, and create a cost estimate which may then be generated into and appropriate table for submission.

To use:

1. Install kivy (min version 1.11.1), kivymd, and openpyxl.
2. Replace these packages with the corresponding packages of the same name included in the repository
3. Ensure all preinstalled python packages are up to date
4. Make sure 'Ruces_Companion_New_Format.py' 'Ruces_Comapanion_GUI.py' and rcgui.kv are in the same folder
